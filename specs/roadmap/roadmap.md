# Roadmap

The project has three phases in general. The first two phases should be completed in May and the third phase should be completed in early June. We first have a planning phase. In this phase, we start with a kickoff meeting talking about meeting logistics and getting to know each other. We then have two brainstorming sessions figuring out which topic to use and what features to include in our project. Next one is the development phase. In this phase, we start with building the prototype of the entire project and building different screens(6 screens) in the project. After that, when we have some basic codes, we begin to build a CI/CD pipeline with testing and linting. And when prototype building is done, we perform some initial testing to find out obvious bugs. At last, we have the testing/revise phase. At this phase, we design more unit tests and E2E tests to test our project and revise our code accordingly. After tests are done, we can finalize the project.

Due to reasons such as time constraints, reserving expansion opportunities, and maintaining strategic flexibilities, we did not include all features we initially intended in this project. For now, we only include music sliders in the settings panel. But in later releases in late June and July, we would like to include some additional features in the settings panel such as dark/light mode toggles, global music/sound effect volume sliders, language translation options to Chinese, and some more features based on feedback we got. We also would like to include a secret menu for users who use the application at specific times. When designing these new features, this existing roadmap could serve as a useful reference as we can acquire experiences of successes and failures from it and have a better plan for these new features.
