# ADR: Fortune Teller App - Choice of Vanilla JS/HTML/CSS over React for Web Development

## Context and Problem Statement

Our team is tasked with building a Fortune Teller app within a limited timeframe of two weeks. We need to decide on the technology stack for the web development, specifically choosing between using vanilla JavaScript/HTML/CSS or the React framework. The decision should consider the team's experience, project timeline, and the app's requirements.

## Considered Options

1. Vanilla JavaScript/HTML/CSS: Building the app using native web technologies without relying on any JavaScript frameworks or libraries.
2. React: Utilizing the React framework for web development, leveraging its component-based architecture and ecosystem.

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: Vanilla JavaScript/HTML/CSS

### Rationale

We have decided to proceed with using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS for developing the Fortune Teller app, rather than adopting the React framework. The reasons for this choice are as follows:

1. Project Timeline: With only two weeks available for development, it is essential to prioritize speed and efficiency. While React offers many advantages, it also introduces a learning curve, especially for team members who are not already experienced with the framework. By opting for vanilla JavaScript/HTML/CSS, we can leverage the team's existing expertise, avoiding the need for additional training or the time required to become proficient in React.

2. Team Experience: Our team consists of members with varying levels of experience and familiarity with web development frameworks. Choosing vanilla JavaScript/HTML/CSS allows us to capitalize on the collective expertise of the team. It ensures that every team member can contribute effectively and minimizes the potential for roadblocks or delays caused by unfamiliarity with React.

3. App Requirements: Considering the specific requirements of the Fortune Teller app, which involve interactive animations and local storage integration, vanilla JavaScript/HTML/CSS is more than capable of fulfilling these needs. The app does not have complex state management or extensive UI components that would warrant the use of a framework like React. Thus, opting for vanilla web technologies aligns well with the app's requirements, providing the necessary flexibility and control over the development process.

By choosing vanilla JavaScript/HTML/CSS, we strike a balance between utilizing the team's existing skill set, meeting the project's timeline, and addressing the app's requirements effectively. This decision allows us to focus on delivering a functional and engaging Fortune Teller app within the given timeframe.
