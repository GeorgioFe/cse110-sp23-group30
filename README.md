# Blue Moon Express

The "Blue Moon Express" project is an interactive web application that allows users to customize their orders from Panda Express, a popular fast-food chain specializing in Chinese-American cuisine, for a fun, fortune-telling experience at the end. The application provides a user-friendly interface where users can easily select their preferred items from the Panda Express menu.

Upon accessing the application, users are presented with a visually appealing and intuitive interface showcasing the various menu items available at Panda Express. Users can browse through the menu categories, such as plates, bowls, and add their desired items to the shopping cart.

To enhance the user experience, the project incorporates a unique featureâ€”a cookie shaking animation. When users confirm their order, they will be treated with a fun and interactive animation where a virtual cookie is shaken on the screen. This animation engages users as they interact with the application.

Through interactive interface, personalized messages, and captivating animations, our website offers users a delightful and entertaining experience that brings a touch of magic and fortune telling to their day.
